# NBC/NXT/NXC compiler

Adapted from [Bricxcc](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bricxcc/) by John Hansen (see <http://bricxcc.sourceforge.net/nbc/>).
This is the latest available release, [1.2.1.r4](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bricxcc/files/NBC_NXC/NBC%20release%201.2.1%20r4/).
I just tried to compile it on a up-to-date linux distribution (because this is the target of my compiler project for an evening class lesson), I do not plan on fixing bugs or anything ;)
